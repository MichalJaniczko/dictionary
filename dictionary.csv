DICTIONARY,"(['A Dictionary (or ""dict"") is a way to store data just like a list, but instead of using only numbers to get the data, you can use almost anything. This lets you treat a dict like it\'s a database for storing and organizing data.'], [' https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex39.html'])"
FUNCTION,"(['A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.'], ['https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm'])"
LIST,"([""A Python data type that holds an ordered collection of values, which can be of any type. Lists are Python's ordered mutable data type. Unlike tuples, lists can be modified in-place.""], ['https://www.codecademy.com/articles/glossary-python'])"
ASCII TABLE,"(['ASCII is an standard that assigns letters, numbers, and other characters within the 256 slots available in the 8-bit code. The ASCII decimal (Dec) number is created from binary, which is the language of all computers. The ASCII table is divided in 3 different sections: non printable, lower ASCII, higher ASCII.'], ['http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/ascii.html'])"
IMMUTABLE,"(['An object with fixed value. Immutable objects include numbers, strings and tuples. Such an object cannot be altered. A new object has to be created if a different value has to be stored. They play an important role in places where a constant hash value is needed such as the keys of a dictionary.'], ['https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonGlossary'])"
CONVERSION,"([""The invocation of a well-defined mechanism from of transforming an instance of one type of object to an instance of another; for example, int('3') will convert a string ('3') to an int (3).""], [' https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonGlossary'])"
DECORATOR,"([""A function that modifies another function or method. Its return value is typically a callable object, possibly the original function, but most often another function that modifies the original function's behavior in some fashion.""], ['https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonGlossary'])"
PARAMETER,"(['In computer programming, a parameter or argument is a value that is passed into a function. Most modern programming languages allow functions to have multiple parameters.'], ['https://techterms.com/definition/parameter'])"
STRINGS,"(['Strings store characters and have many built-in convenience methods that let you modify their content. Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed in place.'], ['https://www.codecademy.com/articles/glossary-python'])"
PRINT(),"(['A function to display the output of a program. Using the parenthesized version is arguably more consistent.'], ['https://www.codecademy.com/articles/glossary-python'])"
VARIABLE,"(['Variables are used in computer programming to store specific values within a program. They are assigned both a data type as well as a value.'], ['https://techterms.com/definition/variable'])"
TUPLE,"(['A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets'], ['https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_tuples.html'])"
ARGUMENT,"(['In computer programming, a parameter or argument is a value that is passed into a function. Most modern programming languages allow functions to have multiple arguments'], ['https://techterms.com/definition/parameter'])"
